The First set of task for developing Rise are as follows :

2. Users need to be able to create Task within a project and manage the each stage of the task development from design to completion using a scrum style system.

3. Users will need a Timer feature to track the amount of time they have spent on a task and one for how much time they've spent on a project as a whole.

4. Users will be required to write a description of what they did for a task and for the project in order to successfully stop and record their time from the timer.

5. Time will need to be able to be displayed in a graphical format to track progress for each user and the team as whole each week.

6. a Module feature will be necessary for organizing a projects' needs. Each task will corrispond with completing a module, which will require the module to be moved from a "Needs to be done" list to "in progress" then "Testing" and Finally "Complete".
